There are two types of variables in PHP: local and global.

Local variables can only be accessed within the function in which they are defined. Global variables, on the other hand, can be accessed from anywhere in the code.

For example: $price in myFunc() is a local variable. That means we can only access it within the myFunc().

The same goes for $age in myFuncTwo().
