To install PHP, we can install XAMPP. This comes with Apache, MySQL, PHP, and other tools.

Once XAMPP is installed, we can start the Apache server on the XAMPP control panel.
Apache is the server that will run our PHP files. On the browser, we can type in localhost/dashboard. It will show the default page of XAMPP. 

We can change the port of Apache clicking on the config button, choose apache (httpd.conf), it will open the file. Scroll down to the listen port and change the port number.
