PHP can communicate with file system on a computer or server.

    1. To open a file, use fopen(${filename}, ${"mode"}). ${mode} can be 'r' for read, 'w' for write, 'a' for append, 'x' for exclusive creation, 'c' for create or open for update, 't' for text mode, 'b' for binary mode, and '+'.

    2. To read a file, we first need to reference the file with fopen() and assign it to a variable. Then, we can use fread(${reference}, ${length}) to read the file. ${length} is the number of bytes to read.

    3. To read a file line by line, we can use fgets(${reference}). If we use fgets(${reference}) again, it will read the next line. This is because of the file pointer. A file pointer is like a cursor that points to the current position in the file.
