We can connect to a database from our php script. But we need to create a user first.
Check all for global privileges.    

We will connect to the database from index.php file.
We can either use the mysqli or PDO. For now we will use the mysqli.

mysqli_connect() has 4 parameters. mysqli_connect(${host}, ${user}, ${password}, ${database}).

We need to check if the connection is successful or not.
