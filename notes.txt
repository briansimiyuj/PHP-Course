Functions are blocks of code that can be executed to perform a specific task.
They can be called multiple times.
We can pass arguments to functions.
If we pass an argument to a function, we have to pass a value to that argument when we call the function.
Or we can specify a default value for the argument, in this case, we don't have to pass a value to the argument when we call the function.
But if we pass a value to the argument, it will override the default value.
