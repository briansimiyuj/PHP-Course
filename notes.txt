Sessions are a way to store and transfer data between multiple pages during a single visit to a website. They store data on the server instead of the client.

The way we do this is by:

    1. Start a session with the session_start() function.
    2. Store data to a session with the $_SESSION['key'] = 'value'; syntax.
    3. Retrieve data from a session with the $_SESSION['key'] syntax. Make sure to start the session if you are on a different file.

We can override the session variable within the same session.

If we want to delete a session variable, we can use the unset() function. unset($_SESSION['key']);. We can also use the session_destroy() function to delete all session variables.
