So let's create our first PHP file. We will call it index.php.
PHP has tags just like HTML. They are <?php and ?>, everything will be between these tags. 
Let's add type hello world in our file, we do that using echo.

If we inspect the page, we see HTML code yet we requested index.php. This is because the server process PHP and then sends the output to the browser as HTML.
