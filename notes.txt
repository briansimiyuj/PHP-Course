 We can take the data we receive from our form and save it to a database. We also need to connect add.php to the database, like we did with the index.php file.

Before we can save data to the database, we need to ensure that the data has no malicious code. We do this by mysqli_real_escape_string(). It takes two parameters, the connection and the data.
