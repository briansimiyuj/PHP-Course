Let's now delete a pizza from the database.
We need to make a form with a hidden field that contains the id of the pizza we want to delete. 
We will use POST request to delete the pizza.


    1. We first need to get the id of the hidden field.
    2.  Then we make a query to delete the pizza.
    3.  Then we check if the query was successful. If it was successful, we redirect to the home page.
