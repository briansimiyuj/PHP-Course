Form validation is a way to verify the data that a user enters into a form is valid.

We need to validate each field in our form. To do this, we use PHP's built-in filter_var() function.

Let's check if the email is valid. 

filter_var() takes two arguments: the data to be validated and the type of validation to be performed. `filter_var(${data}, ${TYPEOFVALIDATION});`
