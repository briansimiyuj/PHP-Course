Now we want to display the details of a single pizza when we click on more info button. Let's create a new file called details.php.

To retreive the details of a pizza, we need to use GET method, since we are passing the id of the pizza on the file path.

    Then let's check if the id is set on the GET array.
    If it is set, we make a query to the database to get the details of the pizza.
    This will return an array with the details of the pizza.
    We can fetch the results as an associative array.
    Then we free the result set and close the connection.
