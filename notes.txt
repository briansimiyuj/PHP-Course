PHP can communicate with file system on a computer or server.

    1. To read a file, we use readFile(`${filePath/fileName.ext}`) function and pass the file name as a parameter. When we view on the browser, we will see the contents of the file and a number of bytes of the file.

    2. To check if a file exists, we use file_exists(`${filePath/fileName.ext}`) function and pass the file path as a parameter.
    
    3. To copy a file, we use copy(`${filePath/fileName.ext}`, `${filePath/newFileName.ext}`) function and pass the file path and the new file path as parameters.

    4. To get the absolute path of a file, we use realpath(`${filePath/fileName.ext}`) function and pass the file path as a parameter.

    5. To get the file size, we use filesize(`${filePath/fileName.ext}`) function and pass the file path as a parameter.

    6. To rename a file, we use rename(`${filePath/fileName.ext}`, `${filePath/newFileName.ext}`) function and pass the file path and the new file path as parameters.

    7. To delete a file, we use unlink(`${filePath/fileName.ext}`) function and pass the file path as a parameter.

    8. To create a directory, we use mkdir(`${filePath/directoryName}`) function and pass the directory path as a parameter.

    9. To navigate to a directory, we use chdir(`${filePath/directoryName}`) function and pass the directory path as a parameter.
