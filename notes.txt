There are 3 types of arrays in PHP;

    1. Indexed Array 
    
        - this is the most common type of array, where each element is referenced by a number. For example, $peopleOne. We count from 0.
        - to access the first element, we use $peopleOne[0]
        - we can initialize an array by using the
            $arrayName = [value1, value2, value3, ...] or
            $arrayName = array(value1, value2, value3, ...)

    2. Associative Array
    3. Multidimensional Array
