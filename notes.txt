We can get the data from the database using SQL queries:

    1. Creating the query - This is where we define the query that we want to   execute. In this case, we want to get the title, ingredients and ID from the pizzas table.
    
    2. Make the query - This is where we execute the query. We do this by using mysqli_query() function. This has two parameters: mysqli_query(${connection}, ${query}).

    3. Fetch the results - This is where we fetch the results from the database. We do this by using mysqli_fetch_all() function. This has two parameters: mysqli_fetch_all(${result}, MYSQLI_ASSOC). This will return an array of associative arrays.

    4. Free the results - This is where we free the results from the database. We do this by using mysqli_free_result() function. This has one parameter: mysqli_free_result(${result}).

    5. Close the connection - This is where we close the connection to the database. We do this by using mysqli_close() function. This has one parameter: mysqli_close(${connection}).
